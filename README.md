# survmissing

The codes in the repository are algorithms for data-driven nonparametric estimators of marginal and conditional density and hazard rate for censored data with different missing mechanisms. In survival analysis lifetimes of interest are often not observed directly due to right censoring. For instance, in a cancer study where the lifetime of interest is from the time of surgery to cancer relapse, that time is right censored if the patient dies from unrelated conditions before the relapse happens. Moreover, 
because this type of event data comes from real-world data collection, missing data is a common complication. Estimation of density and hazard rate, taking the incompleteness of the data into account, is of interest in the survival analysis field as it can allow experts to have more accurate insights into the underlying risk.
Using Rubinâ€™s terminology, there are three types of missing: missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR). The various R codes in the repository are supplements to the following papers:
